# Reaper | BarelyHuman

Built [TillWhen](https://tillwhen.barelyhuman.dev) 
 - A minimal Project based Time Logger, the only app I ever built for others to use.

Also [ftrouter](https://github.com/barelyhuman/ftrouter)
 - Now contrary to the above, this is one of the many tools you'll find in my repository that was built for me.


I build tools and apps for me to use, so a lot of what you'll find in my repositories is built while considering my requirements, you are free to fork any repository and build on top of it if you'd like too.

If you do end up using something and would like to donate
